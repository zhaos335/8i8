	<h1>Ties</h1>
    <h2>Why We Wear Ties</h2>

    <p>What became known as “the tie” approximately three hundred years ago has been in existence for thousands of years, dating as far back as the dawn of human existence.  <br>

    Fashion experts, sociologists and other professionals have been contemplating the tie for years and how it has somehow become the pinnacle of business attire. While many men dread the thought of having to tie the knot, others relish in the fact that they’re carrying on a proud tradition of formality, poise, and elegance.</p>

    <h2>The Birth of the Tie</h2>
    <p>If we go back four thousand years to ancient Egypt, we can examine the necks of many Pharoahs and notice broad ties adorned with precious stones wrapped around their necks. Archeologists have found what is believed to be a talisman known as the Knot of Isis around the necks of mummies. <br>
    It is called that way because it resembles a knot used to secure the garments worn by Egyptian gods and is much older than the terrorist organization that is associated with the world “Isis” today.</p>

    <p>Daniel Roseberry added another traditional surrealist feature to Schiaparelli's 2024 autumn/winter ready-to-wear collection: the braid. <br>
    
    Surrealists frequently use hair to cover regions or items that do not normally sprout hair. <br>

    Meret Oppenheim, an artist, designed a bracelet for Schiaparelli in 1936 with a hair-covered surface.  There's also a tale behind this bracelet. <br>
    
    It is believed that one day in 1936, Oppenheim was drinking coffee with Picasso and DORA Mar.  She was wearing a fur bracelet at the time.  Picasso loved this concept and even commented, "You can cover everything with fur."  Oppenheim responded, "Even this cup and saucer."  Following this, Oppenheim developed his most renowned work: a set of fur-covered coffee cups.</p>
